# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: In this project we predict the fund possibility for an applicant using neural network and binary classification model.

Results:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? The target is IS_SUCCESSFUL. What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? classification, use case, special consideration, application type, income amount. What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? Name columns and EIN

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why? I used two hidden layers with neurons of 25, and 17. Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
